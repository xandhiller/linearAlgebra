\section{Question 1}

Gaussian iteration is given by:

\begin{equation}
  x^{k+1}_{i} = 
  \frac{1}{a_{ii}}
  \bigg( b_{i} - \sum^{n}_{j=1,j\neq i} a_{ij} x_{j} \bigg)
\end{equation}

\section{Question 4}

If the matrix is diagonally dominant, then it is known that Gauss-Siedel
and Jacobi methods will converge.

For our matrix, $\mathbf{A}$:

$$
\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & -1 \\
  1 & 2 & -1 \\
  2 & -1 & 3 \\
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

We can see that it is diagonally dominant (but not strictly diagonally dominant).

And so it should converge for the Jacobi and Gauss-Siedel methods, which it does,
as we've seen in previous questions.
